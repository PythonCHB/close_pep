===========

Documentation and code for a Python PEP about an appoximate equal check for Python

There has been a large discussion on python-ideas about how and whether to add a function to the python standard libary that checks if two values are aproximately equal.

https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2015-January/030947.html

This repo serves as a place to experiment with implimentations, and to cooperate on the drafting of a PEP.

The pep itself is in: ``pep-0485.txt``

A proposed implimentation is in ``is_close_to.py``, with unit tests in ``test_is_close_to.py``, naturally.

I am using this for a workign copy, sothat people can review, submit pull requests, what have you. 

The offical PEP is posted here:

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0485/
and
